Engineered a machine learning model to forecast peak temperature fluctuations in dissimilar 
metals by modulating laser power and welding speed. 
• Leveraged the ML model to clarify the relationship between peak temperature variations and 
input parameter adjustments.  
•  Utilized advanced software and programming tools including Python, ANSYS, and COMSOL 
Multiphysics for simulation and analysis.
